# Usage of the Milano-Bicocca Hercules cluster

## get an account

  * usually an account is made for any student and researcher at the moment of registration
  * if you do not have an account, ask Paolo Dini for one, and if you're a student
    ask your supervisor to provide you with her/his request approval

## login

  * the access server is named ```hercules.mib.infn.it```
  * the server is not accessible from outside the INFN Milano-Bicocca network, 
    therefore one should first connect to ```cerbero```,
    and then from there to ```hercules```:
```
ssh username@cerbero.mib.infn.it
ssh username@hercules.mib.infn.it
```
    
## CMSSW configuration
